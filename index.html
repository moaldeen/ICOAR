                    The tutorial will guide you through through our platform, Integrative Cyberinfrastructure for Online Abuse Research (ICOAR). You'll learn how to collect and preprocess data from various social media platforms, select and apply sophisticated machine learning algorithms for detecting and analyzing online abuse, and conduct thorough data analysis using advanced tools for presenting data analytics.                  </p>

                        <li><strong>Offensive Tweets:</strong> Analysis of COVID-related offensive tweets on Twitter through a large-scale data-driven study, leveraging machine learning techniques to classify the nature and target of offensive content, and employing statistical and network analysis methods to understand the dynamics of how such content spreads and evolves over time. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3580305.3599773">Liao et al. 2023</a></li>
                        <li><strong>Hate Speech:</strong> Detecting and mitigating online hate by leveraging the advanced reasoning capabilities of these models, coupled with zero-shot learning for prompt-based detection. This approach allows for the dynamic updating of detection prompts to address evolving forms of hate speech effectively, showcasing significant improvements in detecting online hate compared to existing tools.

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Image Cyberbullying:</strong> Identifying and classifying cyberbullying in images through unique visual factors such as body pose, facial emotion, objects, and social context, enables a more nuanced understanding of cyberbullying incidents. <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/towards-understanding-and-detecting-cyberbullying-in-real-world-images/">Vishwamitra et al. 2021</a></li>
                        <li><strong>Hateful Memes:</strong> Detecting COVID-19-related hateful memes using Vision and Language (V&L) models. It explores the generalizability of these models to new types of hateful memes, showing a significant preference for visual information over textual. <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10399964">Guo et al. 2022</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Additionally, the tutorial offers hands-on labs designed to equip you with practical experience in applying AI technologies for cyberbullying detection across different media (i.e., text and images). These labs are tailored for students with diverse technical backgrounds,  enhancing our understanding and skills in AI-driven social cybersecurity. </p>
